def get_prompt4_layout_feedback(section, position_table):
    return f"""
0. RESPONSE CONTRACT (CRITICAL):
- Output ONE JSON object only. No prose, no markdown, no code fences.
- Start with '{{' and end with '}}'.

1. ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:
- Analyze this Manim educational video ONLY for layout and spatial positioning issues.
- Use the provided reference image for precise spatial analysis.
- Focus on eliminating overlaps, obstructions, and optimizing grid space utilization.

2. Content Context:
- Title: {section.title}
- Lecture Lines: {'; '.join(section.lecture_lines)}
- Current Grid Occupancy: {position_table}

3. Visual Anchor System (6*6 grid, right side only):
```
lecture |  A1  A2  A3  A4  A5  A6
        |  B1  B2  B3  B4  B5  B6
        |  C1  C2  C3  C4  C5  C6
        |  D1  D2  D3  D4  D5  D6
        |  E1  E2  E3  E4  E5  E6
        |  F1  F2  F3  F4  F5  F6
```
- Point positioning (point, one-word label): self.place_at_grid(obj, 'B2', scale_factor=0.8)
- Area positioning (over-two-words label, fomula, group): self.place_in_area(obj, 'A1', 'C3', scale_factor=0.7)

4. LAYOUT ASSESSMENT (Check ALL):
- Obstruction: Animations blocking left-side lecture notes [ATTENTION]
- Overlap: Animation elements (formulas, labels, shapes) overlapping
- Off-screen: Elements cut off or outside visible area [ESPECIALLY for LONG LABEL]
- Grid violations: Poor grid space utilization
- Check if there are any elements that should fade out but do not

5. MANDATORY CONSTRAINTS:
- Color: Provide hexadecimal color codes for unclear colors.
- Font/Scale: Adjust font sizes and asset scales for grid positions.
- Consistency: Do not apply any animation to the lecture lines except for color changes; The lecture lines and title's size and position must remain unchanged.
- Asset: Only adjust Existing PNG assets' size and position.
- Proximity: Ensure labels stay within 1 grid unit of their objects.

6. IMPORTANT: Output MUST follow this exact JSON structure (NO extra keys):
{{
    "layout": {{
        "has_issues": true,
        "improvements": [
            {{
                "problem": "Specific issue description (concise)",
                "solution": "Line X: self.place_at_grid() or self.place_in_area()",
                "line_number": X,
                "object_affected": "obj_name"
            }}
        ]
    }}
}}

Example (only JSON, no prose):
{{
  "layout": {{
    "has_issues": true,
    "improvements": [
      {{
        "problem": "Legend overlaps axis labels",
        "solution": "Line 142: self.place_at_grid(legend, 'E2', scale_factor=0.8)",
        "line_number": 142,
        "object_affected": "legend"
      }}
    ]
  }}
}}

7. SOLUTION REQUIREMENTS:
- Provide specific grid coordinates in solutions
- List up to 3 layout problems that most affect the visual experience!
- Do not give the video timestamp
- Give concise problem descriptions but detailed, actionable solutions
- Subsequent solution positions should not overlap with previous solution positions
